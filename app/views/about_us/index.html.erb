          The Apurva Natvar Parikh Group was founded in August 1947 by the late Natvarlal Chotalal Parikh. This was the year of Indian independence from generations of colonial rule and there was a tremendous need for the development of infrastructure to meet the needs of the people. Fired by his vision Natvarlal Parikh set up a massive scale of operations including port management, crane rental, container transportation, freight forwarding and heavy transportation. Pioneering in many logistics based activities Natvarlal built a corporate culture of innovation, meticulous planning and economical operations.
